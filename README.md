Authentication Engine for Rails.API multitenant RESTful APIs based on Warden. It:
* Is Racked based
* Use token authentication as strategy for the API
* Is RESTful API
* Allows you to have multiple roles (or models/scopes) signed in at the same time

## Information

### Why Cadenero?
**"Cadenero"** is the spanish word for ["Bouncer (doorman)"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncer_(doorman\)). The main function of **Cadenero** is to be a resource for authenticating consumers of the services that the API provides. As the real bouncers, **Cadenero** aims to provide security, check authorized access, to refuse entry for intoxication, aggressive behavior or non-compliance with statutory or establishment rules. 

### Inatalling **Cadenero**
Generate first your Rails.API app as usual using:
```
> rails-api new your_app --skip-test-unit
```
In the `Gemfile` add the following lines:
```ruby
gem 'cadenero', '~> 0.0.2.a1'
gem 'pg'
```
In the `config/database.yml` replace the `sqlite3` adapter for `postgresql` as follow:
```
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: your_app_development 
  min_messages: warning

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: your_app_test 
  min_messages: warning
```

Then run bundle, create the databases and the generator:
```
> bundle install; rake db:create; rails-api g cadenero:install
```
Finally run the server:
```
rails-api s
```

Check that you can access the API using the default account `www` and user `testy@example.com` with password `changemeËœ for that you can use [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [RESTClient](http://restclient.net/)

Then have fun!

### Access Points
**Cadenero** creates the following versioned routes for exposing the authentication RESTful API

```
   v1_users_new GET  /v1/users/new(.:format) cadenero/v1/users#new
        v1_root      /v1(.:format)           cadenero/v1/account/dashboard#index
     v1_sign_in GET  /v1/sign_in(.:format)   cadenero/v1/account/sessions#new
    v1_sessions POST /v1/sign_in(.:format)   cadenero/v1/account/sessions#create
v1_user_sign_up GET  /v1/sign_up(.:format)   cadenero/v1/account/users#new
v1_user_sign_up POST /v1/sign_up(.:format)   cadenero/v1/account/users#create
     v1_sign_up GET  /v1/sign_up(.:format)   cadenero/v1/accounts#new
    v1_accounts POST /v1/accounts(.:format)  cadenero/v1/accounts#create
        v1_root      /v1(.:format)           cadenero/v1/dashboard#index
```
You can check then running:
```
rake routes
```

### Contributing

We hope that you will consider contributing to **Cadenero**. Please read this short overview for some information about how to get started:

https://github.com/agiltec/devise/cadenero/Contributing

You will usually want to write tests for your changes using BDD tools as RSpec, Rack::Test and Capybara.  To run the test suite, go into **Cadenero**'s top-level directory and run "bundle install" and "rspec".  For the tests to pass, you will need to have a Postgresql server running on your system.

### Warden

**Cadenero** is based on Warden, which is a general Rack authentication framework created by Daniel Neighman. We encourage you to read more about Warden here: https://github.com/hassox/warden

### Rails::API

**Cadenero** is a Rails::API Engine, Rails::API is a subset of a normal Rails application, created for applications that don't require all functionality that a complete Rails application provides. It is a bit more lightweight, and consequently a bit faster than a normal Rails application. The main example for its usage is in API applications only, where you usually don't need the entire Rails middleware stack nor template generation. Rails::API was created by Santiago Pastorino. We encourage you to read more about Rails::API here: https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api

### Multitenancy with Rails And subscriptions too!
Parts of the code of **Cadenero** have been based on the excellent work of [Ryan Bigg](https://github.com/radar) in his book ["Multitenancy with Rails And subscriptions too!"](https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails) but modified to be use in a RESTful API
